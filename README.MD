# Welcome to the TypeScript React + MobX + MUI + Express Boilerplate Project!

## Overview

TypeScript-based boilerplate project designed to jumpstart your development of robust and scalable web applications. This boilerplate integrates several powerful technologies to provide a solid foundation for building modern web applications:

- **React**
- **TypeScript**
- **Material-UI (MUI)**
- **MobX**
- **Express**

## Features

- **TypeScript Support**: Enjoy the benefits of static typing, including enhanced code readability, early bug detection, and improved refactoring capabilities.
- **React Components with MUI**: Build user interfaces using React and Material-UI for a consistent and visually appealing design.
- **State Management with MobX**: Leverage MobX for reactive state management, enabling efficient handling of application state changes across components.
- **Webpack Configuration**: Configured Webpack for the frontend, optimized for both development and production environments.
- **Express Backend**: Communicate with a backend server built using Express, enabling you to handle RESTful APIs and perform CRUD operations efficiently.
- **Shared Project**: Includes a shared project for common functionality between client and server. It may contain general functions and types for seamless communication and integration across the application stack.
- **Linting and Testing:** The project includes linting tools to maintain code quality and is covered by tests for both client and server components to ensure reliability.

## MobX Example

This project includes a demonstration of MobX in action, showcasing its capabilities in managing the application's state. Utilize MobX to handle the state of components such as progress bars, snackbars, and theme modes seamlessly.

## To-Do List Example

This boilerplate includes a practical example application: a To-Do List. Learn how to integrate the aforementioned technologies to create a full-stack application.

- **Frontend**: The To-Do List interface is built using React and Material-UI. Users can add, edit, and delete tasks with ease, leveraging MobX for reactive state management.
- **Backend**: The server, built with Express, manages API requests for handling and storing to-do items. Easily extend this setup to include database integration for scalability.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:Nolesh/React-MobX-MUI-Express-TS-Boilerplate.git
